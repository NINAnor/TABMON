# TABMON: Towards a Transnational Acoustic Biodiversity Monitoring Network

## Goal of this repository

The TABMON project aims to **develop a transnational biodiversity monitoring with autonomous acoustic sensors across a large latitudinal range in Europe**, demonstrating how acoustic sensing can complement existing monitoring efforts to fill current gaps in reporting to EU directives and assessing targets of the EU Biodiversity Strategy target.

The TABMON repository documents and making clearly available all the repositories connected to the [TABMON](https://www.nina.no/english/TABMON) project.
